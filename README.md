##Summary
This project came about as a way to help a friend (Jason) get into python development. His slow internet connection made it very difficult for him to download large files off websites without leaving his computer on indefinitely.  I decided to use his NAS devices ability to run python code as a jumping off point for creating a file downloading web daemon.

##Of Note

* Non-Blocking download threads (Configurable) - default: 2
* Ability to queue a download remotely by simply e-mailing an attached e-mail account
* Low Memory Overhead
